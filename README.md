Small discord bot i've made for my friend's server on python.
Feel free to copy my code and use it for your projects! 
I wouldn't have been able to make this bot without the help of github of Martine discord bot, great thanks to https://github.com/MartineBot and PredaaA

The bot works with discord interaction and can give you examples on such topics as:
- responding on an interaction
- how to work with slash commands
- how to work with discord.ui.view, discord.ui.button, discord.ui.select, discord.ui.modal
- how to work with interaction
- other discord API elements

Sorry for the bad translation in some places, english is not my native language and sometimes i can be wrong.

I understand that my code sometimes looks very goofy, but I don't understand how to make some things better
